# Flow Zone

Flow Zone is a small clone project inspired by [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io). This application is built with React and styled with Styled Components. It employs the Pomodoro Technique, helping users break down their work into focused intervals interspersed with short breaks. This approach enhances concentration, minimizes distractions, and ultimately boosts overall productivity.

## What is Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique was created by Francesco Cirillo as a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
