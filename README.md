### The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique, created by Francesco Cirillo, is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro," from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer used by Cirillo as a university student.

#### The Process

1. **Plan**: Decide on the task to be done
2. **Focus**: Work for 25 minutes
3. **Break**: Take a short 5-minute break
4. **Repeat**: After 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break

This technique helps maintain focus, avoid burnout, and manage distractions while ensuring regular breaks for mental refreshment.
